Building LogWitch for Windows
=============================

GIT on windows pitfalls
-----------------------

To use git on windows, we need a setup for our pagent.exe to work with us:

start pagent.exe from putty package and add your personal key.

Open the command prompt and set the paths for git correctly:

> set PATH=%PATH;C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY
> set GIT_SSH=plink.exe

Now the remote side can be fetched.

> git gui


Build solution or nmake files
-----------------------------

For building using Windows 7 with MS Visual Studio 2010 do the following steps:

- Download log4cplus > 1.1 and build it
- Download and install qt sdk
- Download and build boost

Now prepare the build directory:

mkdir build
cd build

set QTDIR=C:\QtSDK\Desktop\Qt\4.8.1\msvc2010
set BOOSTROOT=C:\Users\sven\workspace\boost_1_49_0

set CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH=C:\Users\sven\workspace\log4cplus-1.1.0-rc4\include
set CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH=C:\Users\sven\workspace\log4cplus-1.1.0-rc4\msvc10\Win32\bin.Release

cmake ..

Now the generated solution can be used to build it.

For shipping we have to add the svg icon plugin and other things. This needs to be determined and written here!
