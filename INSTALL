LogWitch
========

This is a graphical tool for analyzing logfiles. The project uses a CMake controlled
build-process.

Used libraries:
---------------

- boost
- Qt4 (>4.7)
    need component Network
- log4cplus


qtdeclarative5-dev
qtdeclarative5-dev-tools
qttools5-dev-tools

Build instructions:
-------------------

There are two possibilities of building, in source and out of source.
Out of source is recommended if one is not developing.

1) In Source build:

  Go to base directory and execute (this builds RELEASE!):
   cmake .
   make 
   make install

2) Out of source build:

  Make new directory build:
    mkdir build
  
  Build it (DEBUG!):
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug
    make

  Build it (RELEASE!):
    cd build
    cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=release
    make

Packaging:
----------

CMake in conjunction with CPack has a nice feature to create distrubution packages.
To use this feature proceed as mentioned in build instructions. After build has
finished, use cpack to create a package:

  A standard .tar.gz archive:
    cpack

  A RPM (need rpmbuild):
    cpack -G RPM

  A deb package:
    cpack -G DEB

Building for distributions
--------------------------

There is a chance to have a ready to run .sh script in the root folder which is called buildHelper_*.sh
By using this, the correct settings for a given configuration will be used to build the project.
